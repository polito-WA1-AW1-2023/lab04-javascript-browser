# Lab 04: JavaScript in the Browser

In this repository you will find the following file:

- `lab04-js-browser.pdf`: the pdf file containing the lab specification.
- `index.html`: the same HTML page prepared for lab3 updated to dynamically manage the page through JavaScript.
- `custom.css`: the same CSS file prepared for lab3.
- `films.js`: a file containing a list of films inside a JavaScript array (it is used in place of a real database).
- `app.js`: a JavaScript file that executes what is asked by Exercise 1 and 2.
- `app+delete.js`: a JavaScript file that executes what is asked by Exercise 1, 2 and 3.

## Note

By default `index.html` includes `app.js` (the solution to exercise 1 and 2). If you want to enable the solution to all the three exercises, you have to include `app+delete.js` **instead of** `app.js`.
